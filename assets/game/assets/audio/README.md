# Audio

Place BGM and SFX here. Load keys are used in BootScene and can be played via `this.sound.play('key')` or your audio manager.

| File | Load key | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **town-bgm.mp3** | `town-bgm` | RPG Town Loop #1 |
| **route-bgm.mp3** | `route-bgm` | RPG Town Loop #2 |
| **pokemon-center.mp3** | `pokemon-center` | Calm Happy RPG Town |
| **title-screen.ogg** | `title-screen` | rpgchip01 from the 15-pack |

If a file is missing, the loader skips it and the game continues without that track.
